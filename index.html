      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there. I'm Michael and previous to enrolling in the Bootcamp I was formally a Senior Product Marketing Manager for a software company in Atlanta.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy doing home renovations, eating at new restaurants with my wife, and taking photos of our cute 4-month old baby!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To build a relatively small business that enables me and my family to have more freedom than our current 9-5 jobs allow.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Smyrna, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>There are two main reasons. 1) I love building and creating stuff from scratch, and 2) I was a Product Manager at a software company and fell in love with the possibilities.</p>
